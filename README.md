Clone this GitHub repo to your local machine. Make sure to install all  packages listed in the package.json. These include: express, sequelize, mysql2, and dotenv. Once installed, create the database using the script from the db folder. To seed the database, open the terminal and type "node seeds". Refresh your database to see the updates. To test the CRUD functionality, open your terminal and type "node server.js" and then use Insomnia, Postman, or whatever you prefer to perform get, post, put, and delete requests.
